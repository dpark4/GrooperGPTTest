The code simulates a grouping app that shuffles groups in a team for swarms.

The code does work, but it does not include the initial weekly assignments feature or database integration.

It's more seamless and regroups every time, although randomly.

The code does not have any specific algorithm for regrouping. It is random.

Not too many tries, mostly import struggles.

It was good.
